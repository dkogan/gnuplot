Suggests: gnuplot-doc (>= ${source:Version})
Description: A command-line driven interactive plotting program
 Package for making 2D and 3D graphs from data and functions.
 Supports lots of output formats, including drivers for many printers,
 (La)TeX, (x)fig, Postscript, and so on. The X11-output is packaged in
 gnuplot-x11.
 .
 Data files and self-defined functions can be manipulated by internal
 C-like language.  Can perform smoothing, spline-fitting, or nonlinear
 fits. Can work with complex numbers.
 .
 This package is for transition and to install a full-featured gnuplot
 supporting the X11-output. If you want to skip the
 X-windows-dependency (e.g. if you're running a small server) just
 install "gnuplot-nox" and skip this meta-package.

Description: X11-terminal driver for gnuplot
 This package contains the terminal driver that enables gnuplot to
 plot images interactively under X11. Most users will want this, it is
 however packaged separately so that low-end systems don't need X
 installed to use gnuplot.
