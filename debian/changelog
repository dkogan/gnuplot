    first. I'll upload another version shortly that will take care of the

gnuplot (3.7.2-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * debian/rules: installation into DESTDIR is now directly supported
    by the main Makefile, this also fixes the silly "helpfile in wrong
    directory"-bug (closes: #137803)
  * Makefile.in: added libexecdir to get gnuplot_x11 into the right
    directory
  * high urgency because the help cannot be found in the last release
    which renders the package quite unusable.

gnuplot (3.7.2-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * included documentation with doc-base (fixes #31178)
  * gnuplot only depends on svgalib1g | svgalib1g-dummy iff binary depends on

gnuplot (3.5beta6.340-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * gnuplot.el from the source dist added to /usr/doc/gnuplot/ as

gnuplot (3.5beta6.340-5) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * applied a patch sent by upstream gnuplot cgm terminal maintainer
    jim van zandt <jrv@vanzandt.mv.com> to fix bad dashed lines problem
    when using gnuplot's cgm terminal (fixes bug #20183)
  * doesn't link to gnu's readline library anymore, since it probably
    violates the library copyleft (gnuplot is "free" but non-gpl); gnuplot
    uses now its internal readline facility instead

gnuplot (3.5beta6.340-4) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * after talking to upstream authors, gnuplot_x11 is moved to

    accordingly (this surely is a better solution to that missing
    manpage problem with 340-2)
  * applied a rather important patch sent from upstream gnuplot `hidden3d.c'
    maintainer hans-bernhard broeker <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>
  * small bugs fixed in debian/rules

gnuplot (3.5beta6.340-3) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * lasergnu script is left out of the package, since (i) it uses csh,
    (ii) it uses an insecure temporary file programming style ($$), and
    (iii) the default gnuplot policy is *not* to install it;  i've
    contacted the upstream authors concerning the second item above and
    will add lasergnu back to the dist when it is ready (fixes bug #19792)
  * don't recommend c-shell anymore because lasergnu is left out
  * two missing manpages added; i've written them myself, they are not
    "official" as far as the gnuplot program is concerned
  * `gnuplot.gih' is now in the correct /usr/share/gnuplot directory
  * all the above changes makes lintian 0.3.1 satisfied

  * portable network graphics (png) now works with gnuplot (fixes #16711)

    james troup <jjtroup@comp.brad.ac.uk> (fixes #17207)

gnuplot (3.5beta6.319-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upgraded to upstream version
  * Upstream version is actually "3.6 beta 319", but I don't think
    I can call it 3.6beta319, as that will create problems when
    the real 3.6 comes out (3.6beta319 > 3.6, so dselect will refuse
    to install 3.6 over 3.6beta319). If I could have used a better name,
    please tell me.
  * This release doesn't have the debian-specific ../demo/defaults.ini
    file, as I couldn't find a description for it in the debian files,
    and the propper defaults may have changed a bit any way
  * I allow configure/autoconf to make the configure/makefiles
    in stead of including the makefiles from the distribution.
  * Unfortunately, the csh lasergnu script changed too much for me
    to be able to reliably pach it back to usebash (I don't use the
    lasergnu script myself). So, gnuplot again recommends csh (sorry).
  * package registers menuentry.
